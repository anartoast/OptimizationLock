# Instruções base
Para seguir com a instalação da config substitua o arquivo gameinfo.gi em ``steamapps/common/deadlock/game/citadel`` com a versão baixada desse repositório.
**Vídeo tutorial** (em inglês) para instalação a seguir [aqui](https://youtu.be/TbjLbQVN2kE)

# Tabela
Segue aqui uma lista de cada configuração presente neste repositório.
| Config File                                                                                                                     | Purpose                                                                                                              |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Sqooky's Config/Optimizationlock Default](https://github.com/Sqooky/OptimizationLock/blob/main/Sqooky's%20.gi/gameinfo.gi)                                    | Performance oriented with the intent of not making the game ugly. I would recommend this for most users.                                                    |
| [Test_Cfg](https://github.com/Sqooky/OptimizationLock/blob/main/test_cfg/gameinfo.gi) | Sqooky's config but the test branch. Might cause minor issues but should perform better. |
| [Boot's Max Fps](https://github.com/Sqooky/OptimizationLock/blob/main/boot's%20maxium%20fps%20config/gameinfo.gi)                                    | Heavily performance oriented, currently this config gives the best fps out of all configs tested.
| [Kaizuchaneru's Minimum Spec](https://github.com/Sqooky/OptimizationLock/blob/main/kaizuchaneru's%20minimum%20spec/gameinfo.gi) | This config prioritizes fps above all else and dramatically reduces graphical quality. Recommended for bad computers |
| [Piggy's gameinfo.gi](https://github.com/Sqooky/OptimizationLock/tree/main/piggy's%20config)                                    | Base optimizations but is here for if you want to use his config                                                     |
| [Convars.txt](https://github.com/Sqooky/OptimizationLock/blob/main/convars.txt)                                                 | Every single convar in the game's code. Not a proper config but instead a reference.                                 |
| [Base_convars.txt](https://github.com/Sqooky/OptimizationLock/blob/main/base_convars.txt)                                       | All of the convars used in optimizationlock's defaults in case you want to add them manually.                        |



To manually add convars you need to open up gameinfo.gi, ctrl+f ``convars`` and paste the commands after the ``{`` 
When adding convars manually make sure to not remove `` rate {`` or place them in its bracket, as it will cause the game to not launch
```
Convars {
//you want your convars to begin on this line-


// And end on this one.
rate {
```

# "THE MAP IS WEIRD AND DARK AFTER INSTALLING THE CONFIG"
Lower your ingame shadow settings to medium or low
# FAQ
- "How do I find a value in the config"  
Press ctrl+f in your text editor and type in the string you want.  
- "How do I restore a value to default"  
Comment it out.  
- "What does commenting mean"  
to comment a line put ``//`` at the front of the line. It will make it not executed by the config.  
- "Why are my characters dark in the portraits on the end screen and shop"  
``lb_enable_dynamic_lights`` set it to ``true``
- "Why are buildings popping in and out"  
``r_farz`` or ``r_mapextents`` comment them out.  
- "How do I change my fov"  
``citadel_camera_hero_fov`` or ``r_aspectratio`` Comment this out or lower the value.  
- "The config broke this patch"  
the gameinfo.gi gets overwritten every major update. You need to manually replace it again.  
- "I can't see boxes past a certain distance"  
``r_size_cull_threshold "0.7"``
- "I can't see trooper healthbars past a certain distance"  
change the values ``r_size_cull_threshold`` ``sc_fade_distance_scale_override``
- "Can't see the Doorman ult indicator"  
Set ``cl_ragdoll_limit`` to `` "-1"``
- "There's holes in victor and paige at certain angles"  
Comment out ``sc_screen_size_lod_scale_override`` or increase the value.
- "Sinners lights are little triangles"

``citadel_portrait_world_renderer_off`` comment it out or set it to false  
- "I'm using boot's/kaiz's config and I can't see lash's ground slam"

# Credits 
  Major thanks to all of these individuals from the bottom of my heart. They are all lovely.

- JasperP:              My personal hero.  
- Artemon121:           Made the Citadel cvar unhider, which helped Abdalla fetch cvars and test in-game.

- Brullee:              Removed fake cvars, redundant commands, added cvarlist.md, and reformatted config  
- Dacooder:             Made a wonderful video highlighting me and the config.  
- Kaizuchaneru:         While not directly invovled in the deveopment, they tested most cvars  
- Kin:                  Did an insane amount of benchmarking unprompted.  
- Krisha:               Acts as my guinea pig for test versions.

# Pretty Important Announcement
In the patch from a while back there was a change to citadel_main_english.txt stating "Unable to enter matchmaking while any party member has changes to ConVars in Gameinfo.gi or is running Tools-Mode." At present moment it is not fully implemented.
That aside it is possible that in the future valve will properly implement this, thus restricting the usage of convars ingame. Until that happens (and most likely after it happens) I will still be working on this project. 

Until then you should consider writing [a forum post](https://forums.playdeadlock.com/) going "heyyyyyy I'm scared I won't be able to play this game at ~+60fps if cvars are properly disabled" as it is the most direct way to provide feedback to the developers
